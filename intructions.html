  <h3>The Simon Game is a game that tests your memory by letting you memorize and press buttons in a certain order. At level 1, the computer will press a button, and then you have to press the same button that the computer pressed. At the next level, the commputer will press another random button. You have to press the button that the computer pressed at level 1 as well as the button that the computer pressed at level 2 in the correct order. Every single level is basically the same thing, except it gets harder to memorize the order of the buttons. At one point, you'll press the wrong button or press it in the wrong order, and then you'll lose the game.</h3>
